# Clean_City_WebProject
Project Description:

The Clean City Project is a web-based application aimed at improving the cleanliness and waste management systems of urban areas. This project uses Java, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), HTML, and CSS to create an interactive platform where users can report cleanliness issues, track waste management schedules, and provide feedback on city sanitation.

The system connects to a backend database using JDBC, allowing users to interact with data in real-time. It offers features such as reporting garbage collection issues, viewing the nearest waste collection points, and monitoring waste collection history.

Key Features:

User Registration and Login:

Users can create accounts and log in to the system using a secure authentication mechanism.

Profile management allows users to update personal information.

Reporting Cleanliness Issues:

Registered users can report issues related to garbage collection, overflowing bins, or general cleanliness concerns.

Issues are logged into a database and categorized (e.g., garbage bins, street cleanliness, etc.).

View Waste Management Schedules:

Users can view the schedules for garbage collection in their locality.

The system displays the upcoming waste collection dates and times for different areas.

Admin Panel:

The admin has access to an interface where they can view all reported issues, manage user feedback, and update waste collection schedules.

Admins can also mark reported issues as resolved and track the status of garbage collection teams.

Technologies Used:

Frontend:

HTML: Used to create the structure and content of web pages.

CSS: Used to style the website, ensuring itâ€™s user-friendly and visually appealing.

Backend:

Java: The core language for the backend logic of the application.

JDBC: Provides connectivity between the Java application and the database. The database stores user information, reported issues, feedback, waste collection schedules, etc.

Database:

A Relational Database (MySQL) is used to store user data, cleanliness issues, feedback, and schedules.

The JDBC API facilitates the communication between the Java application and the database to retrieve or update information.
to users about upcoming waste collection times based on the data stored in the database.
